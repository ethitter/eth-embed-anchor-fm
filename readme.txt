Allow embedding Anchor.fm podcast episodes in your content.

== Description ==

Adds [Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/) as an oEmbed provider, allowing you to embed a podcast episode in content simply by pasting its URL.

For ease of discovery, this plugin also adds to the block editor a variation of the embed block specifically for Anchor.fm.

For additional flexibility, a shortcode is provided, which can be used with the iframe that Anchor.fm provides.
